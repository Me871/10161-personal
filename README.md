My personal repository for robotics research.

## Research Topics
### Safety
We've never had this issue, but it'd be a good idea to ground the robot body [using this](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/ftcdocs/blob/main/docs/source/hardware_and_software_configuration/configuring/managing_esd/managing-esd.rst#step-4-ground-electronics-to-metal-frame-with-an-approved-cable).

### Improvements
We should look into using [pneumatics](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/technical-resources/frc_pneumatics_manual.pdf) to make linear movements easier.

### Luxury Features
We could [use an LED strip](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/blob/master/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples/ConceptLEDStick.java) to give drivers feedback as to where an element is.
We could have a [robot log](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Datalogging) (like a flight recorder) to make it easier to diagnose issues.
